# Reelify
A simply Python tool that automates the process of adding logos, watermarking, and editing a demo reel for a collection of digital artwork. Prepping your art to be posted on your portfolio can always take some time, so this tool is designed to make that process more efficient whilst also offering a variety of different settings to the user.
